## Technical Considerations

### Core Dependencies
- **MCP Protocol**: Custom JSON-RPC implementation
- **HTTP Client**: `net/http` with retries and rate limiting
- **Email**: `go-imap`, `net/smtp`
- **OAuth**: `golang.org/x/oauth2`
- **Database**: SQLite for local storage, PostgreSQL for production
- **Logging**: `logrus` or `zap`
- **Configuration**: `viper`
- **Testing**: Go's built-in testing + `testify`

### Architecture Principles
- Modular design with clear interface boundaries
- Concurrent processing with proper error handling
- Graceful degradation when services are unavailable
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Security-first approach with defense in depth
- Extensible plugin architecture

### Risk Mitigation
- **API Changes**: Version all external API integrations
- **Rate Limits**: Implement aggressive rate limiting and queuing
- **Authentication**: Use secure token storage and refresh mechanisms
- **Data Loss**: Implement comprehensive backup and recovery
- **Security**: Regular security audits and dependency updates
- **Scalability**: Design for horizontal scaling from the start

## Success Metrics
- Successful authentication and basic operations on 3+ platforms
